How to build the project

First we must create our ROS project workspace and clone the sourcecode from the repository:

Open a new terminal (this is important) and execute the following commands:

	$ cd ~

	$ git clone https://github.com/alejandrolunadj/ROS_Challenge catkin_ws

	
	
	
Now we will compile for the fist time using the following command:
	
	$ cd ~/catkin_ws
	
	$ catkin_make


From now to compile we must do the followinng commands

	$ cd ~/catkin_ws

	$ catkin_make
